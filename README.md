# Prototype objectives

These are some of the main objectives with this project:

## 1. Main gameplay mechanics

Main gameplay mechanics include, but are not limited to:

### 1.1. Movement

8 direction constant velocity movement, controlled using the left stick for controllers, and the arrow keys for keyboard. Applied movement vector length should be the same in any direction.

**Dash**: The player can dash by pressing the main action button (A for Xbox controllers, Cross for PlayStation, ...) on controllers, and the space key for keyboard. By doing this, the player bursts into movement in their facing direction. Should have a cooldown.

### 1.2. Gathering

### 1.3. Combat

## 2. Randomized World Generation

## 3. A System that is simple to extend

For any parts of this project, the goal is to make clean, expandable code that will not be a hassle to update or change in the future.

## 4. NPC interactions

## 5. Simple online multiplayer
